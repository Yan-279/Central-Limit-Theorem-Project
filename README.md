Yannick Kirane PETRUS - Central Limit Theorem Project for Probability and Statistics

At first, the lists are created as wanted and I am using the sum for L2 instead of the mean.
Then the code is stored inside a function to be run and tested with multiple different values.

When changing "N" the number of times we take samples, we see that only when taking a larger value of N, the histogram look more like a bell curve.
When changing "size" the number of samples taken every time, we that the histogram still keeps the appearance of a bell shape even with less number of samples taken each time.
